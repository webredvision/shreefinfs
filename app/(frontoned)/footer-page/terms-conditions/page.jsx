                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Net Asset Value (NAV):</b> The value of mutual fund units is based on the applicable NAV, which fluctuates based on market conditions.</li>
                            <li><b>Commissions and Fees:</b> Distributors may receive commissions (upfront, trail, or otherwise) from Asset Management Companies (AMCs). These should be transparently disclosed to the investor.</li>
                            <li><b>Entry and Exit Loads:</b> Some mutual fund schemes may charge entry (at the time of purchase) or exit loads (at the time of redemption). Investors should be informed about these charges beforehand.</li>
                            <li><b>Execution-Only Platform:</b> MFDs may offer an execution-only platform, meaning they execute transactions without providing investment advice.</li>
                            <li><b>KYC Compliance:</b> Investors must complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) process before investing.</li>
                            <li><b>Right to Information:</b> Investors have the right to receive all relevant information about the mutual fund schemes, including scheme information documents, key information memorandums, and periodic statements.</li>
